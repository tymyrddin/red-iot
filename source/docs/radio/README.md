# Introduction

## What?

IoT devices don’t always need a continuous wireless transmission across long distances. Manufacturers often use short-range radio technologies to connect devices equipped with cheap, low-powered transmitters. These technologies allow devices to exchange low volumes of data at longer intervals, and as a result, they’re well suited for IoT devices that want to save power when they’re not transmitting any data. Examine them.

## Why?

Looking for exploitable vulnerabilities.

## How?

* Short Range Radio: Abusing RFID
* Bluetooth Low Energy
* Medium Range Radio: Hacking Wi-Fi
* Long Range Radio: LPWAN
