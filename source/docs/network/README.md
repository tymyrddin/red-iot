# Introduction

## What?

Learn which tools we can use and whether we can expand those toolsâ€™ capabilities.

## Why?

Assessing the security of services in IoT systems can sometimes be challenging, because these systems often use newer protocols supported by very few security tools, if any at all.

## How?

* Network assessments
* Analysing protocols
* Exploiting Zero-Configuration Networking
